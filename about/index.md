My name is Aabir Abubaker Kar.

I am currently a pursuing an [MA in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) at **The University of Chicago**.

I'm also a researcher [The Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) where I'm analyzing textual data on job advertisements to better understand up-skilling, labor markets, and teams.

I have a **BE in Engineering** and an **MSc in Physics** from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in India. I also have a Minor Certificate in Philosophy, Economics and Politics.

I've previously been a researcher at the [New England Complex Systems Institute](http://necsi.edu/) and the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in/).

View some of my projects [here](https://bakerwho.github.io/projects/).

My research interests are in complex socioeconomic systems - social stratification, information propagation, economic flows amongst them. I'm generally fascinated by theories of learning, both machine and human.
