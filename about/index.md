My name is Aabir Abubaker Kar.

I am currently a pursuing an MA in Computational Social Science at The University of Chicago.

I have a **BE in Engineering** and an **MSc in Physics** from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in India. I also have a Minor Certificate in Philosophy, Economics and Politics.

I've previously been a researcher at the [New England Complex Systems Institute](http://necsi.edu/) and the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in/).


My research interests are complex systems, reinforcement learning, and applications of information theory. I'm generally fascinated by theories of learning, both machine and human.

I'm also a freelance tutor and writer with a passion for clear communication. I firmly believe that there are no boring topics, only poor teaching and writing.
