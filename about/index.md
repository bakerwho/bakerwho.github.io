My name is Aabir Abubaker Kar.

I am currently a pursuing an [MA in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) at **The University of Chicago**. I graduate in June 2021

I'm working as a researcher [The Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) where I'm characterizing how algorithmic models respond to textual news data from partisan sources. I'm simultaneously working at the lab of John Paparizzos of the Computer Science Department on a novel application of NLP-inspired deep learning to time-series data classification.

Since 2017, I have worked as a data scientist, researcher, business analyst, or some combination of these at some phenomenal places - Zipline (San Francisco, USA), the International Center for Theoretical Sciences (Bengalurur, India), and the New England Complex Systems Institute (Cambridge, USA).

I hold a **BE in Engineering** and an **MSc in Physics** from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in India. I opted into my Master's as a 'reverse dualite' - an uncommon decision in India. I also hold from BITS a Minor Certificate in Philosophy, Economics and Politics.

I've previously been a researcher at the [New England Complex Systems Institute](http://necsi.edu/) and the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in/).

[Here](https://bakerwho.github.io/projects/) are some of my projects.

My research interests are in deep learning and its sociopolitical implications - including the political polarization of algorithmic performance, detecting bias in news media, and the structure of knowledge bases. As a social scientist, I'm also deeply interested in theories of knowledge, learning, and cognition.
