My name is Aabir Abubaker Kar.

I have a **BE in Engineering** and an **MSc in Physics** from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in India. I also have a Minor Certificate in Philosophy, Economics and Politics.

I'm currently a researcher at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in/).

I've previously been a researcher at the [New England Complex Systems Institute](http://necsi.edu/).

I like physics, poetry, programming and politics.  
Actually, I like lots of other things, but these four are sort of alliterative.

My research interests are in reinforcement learning, multi-scale information, complex systems, and the problems of rational decision-making. I'm generally fascinated by theories of learning, both machine and human.

I'm also a freelance tutor and writer with a passion for clear communication. I firmly believe that there are no boring topics, only poor teaching and writing.

I'm also an alleged Mechanical Engineer.
