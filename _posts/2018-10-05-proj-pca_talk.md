In 2018, I had the chance to speak at 3 Python conferences in 3 continents - in Johannesburg, Washington D.C., and Manipal, India.

While undoubtedly a fantastic experience in developing my ability to deliver technical talks, these experiences have made me a sworn fan of FOSS (Free Open Source Software) culture and the inclusiveness and positivity of the PyCon and PyData communities at large.

Here's the video from PyData DC:

Resources for the coding walkthrough can be found [here](https://github.com/bakerwho/pca_pycon_talk). The idea behind the demo was to extract insights from the Netflix movie database - our own take on the popular Netflix Challenge from back in the day.
