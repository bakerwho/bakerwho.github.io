At the University of Chicago, I was deeply interested in the work of Prof. James Evans, a sociologist who synthesizes 

In our attempt to formalize the analysis, we dipped into color theory, cognitive theory, machine learning, and information theory.

The result was [compsyn](https://github.com/bakerwho/comp-syn) - a Python package that offers a novel method to explore the relationship between color and the semantic meaning of concepts.

The image below used our `get_composite_image()` method to generate what we call a colorgram of pictures of the entire CSSS19 cohort.

We now have a quantitative framework with which we can analyze digital images in a perceptually uniform colorspace and measure the statistical relationships between color and cognition.

`pip install compsyn` to try it yourself.
